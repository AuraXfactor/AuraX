## 📋 What You Need to Do

### 🚨 CRITICAL: Update Firestore Rules
**This is the ONLY thing you need to do for everything to work:**

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Select project: `aura-app-prod-4dc34`  
3. Go to **Firestore Database** → **Rules** tab
4. **Replace ALL existing rules** with the content from `/workspace/UPDATED_FIRESTORE_RULES.txt`
5. Click **Publish**

**Without this step, posts and chat will still show permission errors!**

### ✅ Testing After Rules Update
1. Go to `/debug-all-systems`
2. Click "Run Complete System Test" 
3. Verify all systems show ✅ green checkmarks
