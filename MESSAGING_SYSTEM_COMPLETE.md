2. **File Size**: Limited to 10MB for uploads
3. **Group Size**: No explicit limit but consider performance
4. **Offline Support**: Basic caching, full offline mode needs more work

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Deploy**: Update Firestore rules and deploy the app
2. **Test**: Comprehensive testing on multiple devices
3. **Monitor**: Check for any permission errors in console
4. **Optimize**: Performance tuning based on usage
5. **Scale**: Add more advanced features as needed

## 📞 Support

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Check Console**: Look for Firebase/Firestore errors
2. **Verify Rules**: Ensure Firestore rules are deployed
3. **Test Auth**: Make sure users are properly authenticated
4. **Check Permissions**: Verify users have proper access rights

## 🎯 Success Metrics

The new messaging system provides:
- ✅ **Security**: End-to-end encryption for all messages
- ✅ **Performance**: Real-time updates with optimized queries
